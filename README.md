## RSpec Day!

### Overview

We are super excited to offer a guest lecture from the TDD + pair programming
masters at Pivotal Labs! We typically have a traditional lecture and Q+A session
each morning from 9 until 10:30 - 11ish.

It would be great if the Pivots visiting App Academy would hold a lecture on TDD
and RSpec topics. An actual demonstration of industrial TDD would be an amazing
experience that the students would truly benefit from. We have taught this
content since the dawn of our program but would love to have some industry
eyes on it so we can improve!

In addition, if the visitors would like to assist the students as they work on
the day's projects that would be wonderful and very much appreciated!

I have tried to attach all the material for this day of our program as well as
lecture notes from previous lectures. Please let us know if there is any other
information, clarification, anything we can provide to help prepare for the day!

Thanks Again!
